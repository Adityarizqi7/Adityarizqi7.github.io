      <description>Mathtics App ReleaseI am very happy because I have released one of the projects that I have made. This project is called Mathtics App. Initially this project was made because at that time I was dumbfounded and suddenly thought of making an auxiliary calculator to work on math problems and so finally I immediately made the application and finished it.
