This project is called Mathtics App. Initially this project was made because at that time I was dumbfounded and suddenly thought of making an auxiliary calculator to work on math problems and so finally I immediately made the application and finished it. For now the application is in the development stage, there are still only a few features added and maybe in the future there will be features that can be used by users.</description></item></channel></rss>
